<b>Object Oriented Programming Lab 0<b>


The objective of this lab is to get you acquainted with the AutolabJS setup.<br>
The problem of this lab is to print a statement.<br>

You have to create a file named "Lab0.java", which would have a class named "Lab0".<br>

The class would have a main method which would use System.out.println to print the line<br> 
"My name is <your name>", where <your name> is your name, for example: 
"My name is Rohan".

Only the print functionality should be implemented.<br>

Use the instructions provided on Moodle and follow them carefully. <br>
Make sure the directory structure is specified as in the instructions.<br>
