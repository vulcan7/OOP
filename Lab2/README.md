**Object Oriented Programming Lab2** 

The objective of this lab is to test the understanding of constructors, arrays and function calls in Java.<br>

The problem statement is defined in the javadoc provided. Please go through the notes below for additional information.<br>

Steps to get started:
1. Download the docs.zip and extract it.
1. Open index.html page. This page contains all the information about the class and methods to be created. 
1. For this lab, you have to create three classes named `Square`, `Triangle` and `Shape`. Define the properties and methods as described in the javadoc.
1. Go through the javadoc carefully, and take care of the method signatures. 
1. No main method has to be created in any class. 
1. Make sure the parameter types, return types, and print statements match exactly as given in the javadoc.
1. Create a repository named `Lab2` on your Gitlab account and upload your solution according to the directory structure and filenames provided in the AutolabJS instructions and javadoc.
1. Submit on AutolabJS for `Lab2`.

Note:
1. You can declare and create a new array, using the new operator. For example, an int array of size 100 can be declared like this:
```java
int[] sampleArray = new int[100];
```
1. Since you are using `Triangle` and `Square` class in `Shape`, all the three class files should be in the same directory for the import to work correctly. 
1. All calculations are of integer type. Do not use any other datatype for the same.
1. You can submit any number of times till the deadline ends. 
1. For final consideration, only your best score across all submissions will be taken.
