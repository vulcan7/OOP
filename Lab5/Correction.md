1. In the method, `isRegistrationSuccessful()` in `Student` class, the check is to see if the credits of the students for the courses registered by him/her is greater than or equal to the minimum credits(defined by `minCredits`), and the number of courses taken is less than or equal to the max number of courses(defined by `MAX_NUMBER_OF_COURSES`).
2. In the method, `exceedsMaxCredits()` in `Student` class, the credits passed as the parameter are the credits of the course to be added which is called in `registerCourse` method. So the parameter passed `credit` has to be added to `numCredits`, which is a class variable, and then check if it is less than or equal to the maxNoOfCredits.
